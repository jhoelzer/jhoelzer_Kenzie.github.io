        <h3>HTML: Hypertext Markup Language</h3>
        <p><b>HTML</b> is a markup language that tells browsers how to structure a web page. It consists of a series of elements, which alter the way the page looks and behaves.</p>
        <p><b>Block-level elements</b> form a visible block on a web page, appearing on a separate line from the content before and after it. <b>Inline elements</b> are contained within block-level elements and only surround small parts of the content. These normally appear inside a paragraph text and will not cause a new line to appear in the document. <b>Empty elements</b> are elements that consist only of a single tag (no closing tag), such as the "img" tag.</p>
        <p><b>Attributes</b> are additional parts of a tag that contain information about the element. An attribute should have:
        <ul>
            <li>a space between it and the element name</li>
            <li>the attribute name followed by an equals sign</li>
            <li>an attribute value, with opening and closing quotation marks around it</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </body>
